# Quantile plots:

Recall our trusty mtcars example!

```{r}
#Base R; do not use for exam - use tidyverse
attach(mtcars)
qqnorm(wt, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(wt, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)
```

Does weight of cars (per 1000 lbs) look symmetric to you? Hold this thought.

#Normal Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1021)
z=rnorm(32, 3, 1)

#show the histogram using base R because I did not create a data frame
hist(z)


#transform to data frame for ggplot function
z=tibble(z)
ggplot(z, aes(z))+geom_histogram(bins = 6)

ggplot(z, aes(sample=z)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()

``` 

Why tibble and not dataframe? If I want to create a table of my categorical data; tibble allows us to partition a variable based on the levels of a variable.

E.g. A tibble of Employed (Yes/No) and voting party (Liberal/Con/NDP). If you wanted to create a a 2 x 3 table, you can do table (tibble).

## Right-skewed

```{r}
set.seed(1021)
y=rgamma(32, 1, 1)

 #Used base R hist instead ggplot because at this stage I had no dataframe to give ggplot()

hist(y) 

#create a data frame
y=tibble(y)

ggplot(y, aes(sample=y)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```


## T-distribution

```{r}
set.seed(1021)

#df=n-1
w=rt(32, 31)

#use base R as I have no data frame yet
hist(w)


w=tibble(w)

#for large df it starts to look to look Gaussian/normal
ggplot(w, aes(sample=w)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```

Additional HW: Try changing the sizes of the aforementioned to 1000 for the normal distribution and the gamma. See what happens to the scatter of the data in relation to the qqpline. 


# Matched Pairs

Let's look at Prof. Butler's example from lectures:

```{r}
url = "https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/analgesic.txt"
pain_original<-read_table(url)
```

Suppose the two groups were independent then what test would we be performing?

Let us assume we have equal variance. 

```{r}
with(pain_original, t.test(druga, drugb, var.equal = T))
```

Why is this a matched pairs design?

```{r}
#We cannot assume independence so let's specify this
with(pain_original, t.test(druga, drugb, paired = T))
```

The within subject differences resulted in a standard error that was larger when we assumed that the groups were independent. The result was a larger p-value. 

We still fail to reject the null hypothesis (marginally) at the alpha=0.05 level that the difference between drug A and drug B appear to be significantly in managing pain.  

**Note: All of this assumes that the difference between the two groups is normally distributed. Let's check if we are onto something..**

```{r}
pain<- pain_original %>% mutate (pain_diff=druga-drugb)
attach(pain)

#first check - we have a lower outlier. 
ggplot(pain, aes(x=pain_diff)) + geom_boxplot(col="black", fill="blue", bins=6)+coord_flip()

#suspect point in the lower quartile. 
ggplot(pain, aes(sample=pain_diff)) + stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()
```
Question: Should we use a test that relies on the mean?

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(smmr)

#Is the median different from zero?

#H0 = mu_A-mu_B=0, HA: mu_A-mu_B \neq 0

#sample median (x_A-x_B); how far from zero?

sign_test(pain, pain_diff, 0)
```

What conclusion can we make from the two-sided p-value (i.e. 0.14599) about the original t-test?

#Mood's Test

The sign test examines how many values are above and below a specified mean. The Mood's test looks at the median of all the ordered data, and then asks how many are above or below said median. 

Question: This is a contingency table, so what test do we use here? *Hint: A value either is or is not above a particular median, which is a binomial test. What does our sampling distribution look like for a large n?*

$Z = X-np/\sqrt{(np(1-p))}\sim N(0,1)$ CLT for large $n$. 

Also, $Z^2 \sim \chi^2_1$. 

Let's examine Prof. Butler's example again about Daylight savings:

```{r}
my_url <- "http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/dst.txt"
dst <- read_delim(my_url," ")
dst

#Chi-square test around the mean:

tab=with(dst,table(gender,agree))
tab
chisq.test(tab,correct=F) #The correct=F is to stop the approximation they do based on low cell counts. 

dst<- dst %>% mutate(agree1=ifelse(agree=="yes", 1, 0))
dst %>% summarize(med=median(agree1)) %>% pull(med) -> m
tab=with(dst,table(gender,agree1>=m))
tab

median_test(dst,agree1,gender)




```
